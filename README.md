# Welcome to MCP (Model Context Protocol)

This repository serves as an introduction to Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) and related tools.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a capability supported by Anthropic AI models that allows you to create custom tools for any compatible client. MCP clients like Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, or Zed can run an MCP server which "teaches" these clients about new tools they can use.

## Featured Tool: BrowserTools MCP

One excellent example of an MCP tool is BrowserTools MCP, which enables AI-powered applications to capture and analyze browser data through a Chrome extension.

### BrowserTools MCP Architecture

BrowserTools MCP consists of three core components:

1. **Chrome Extension**: Captures screenshots, console logs, network activity, and DOM elements
2. **Node Server**: Acts as middleware between the Chrome extension and MCP server
3. **MCP Server**: Implements the Model Context Protocol and provides standardized tools for AI clients

└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └───────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

### Key Features

- Monitor browser console output
- Capture network traffic
- Take screenshots
- Analyze selected elements
- Wipe logs stored in the MCP server
